                            <strong>Study of Spanning tree with Maximum number of leaves</strong>
                            <p class="details">
                                Spanning Tree of a graph is a tree where all nodes are connected. A graph might have
                                multiple spanning tree. A maximum leaves spanning tree (MLST) is a tree whose number of
                                leaves is maximum. Finding MLST of a graph is a NP-hard problem. It is also APX-hard,
                                which means it's approximation ratio is bounded by a constant. By finding the MLST of a
                                network, we can find the backbone of the network, which can be used to refuce cost of
                                the network. In this work, we tried to find an approximate algorithm for the MLST of a
                                graph. We provide a heuristic algorithm following bottom-up approach.

                                The Chakma language is a endangered language spoken by the Chakma people from
                                Bangladesh. Not so many resources are available in Chakma language. Here we introduce a
                                novel multilabel dataset for the Chakma language. The dataset contains 111,382
                                handwritten character images. We also introduce a novel data collection method and
                                provide a baseline model and
                                provide statistics, comparing with the state-of-the-art models. We provide a novel
                                pipeline for handwritten character recognition. First we convert handwritten characters
                                to font type images using GAN, then we use a Visual Transformer based model for
                                classification.

                                In this work we introduce a novel bilingual and monolingual corpus for the Chakma
                                language. The dataset consists of 13,000 sentences, collected from various ources
                                including online crowd sourcing. We then expriment with NMT and SMT.

                                In this work we have curated a dataset from various sources. Then reverse engineered the
                                APKs to for source code analysing using APKtool for decompiling. We made a code parser
                                and extracted import, method invocation and parameter based features from the source
                                code. Afterwords, recursive feature enimilation and PCA was used for feature reduction.
                                Then we ran tree based models for classification of benign and malicious apps. We ran
                                feature importance on the collected dataset and found that, method invocation based
                                featuers are the most important features.
